More information on how the ML results are interpreted to provide geothermal insights is discussed in our research paper.

## Introduction

- The Great Basin is the largest area of contiguous endorheic watersheds in North America
- It spans nearly all of Nevada, much of Oregon and Utah, and portions of California, Idaho, Wyoming, and Baja California, Mexico
- The Great Basin includes multiple geothermal reservoirs ranging from low- to high-temperature
- The Great Basin has huge potential geothermal potential 
- Further explorations requires an understanding of the local/regional as well as spatial/temporal patterns in various geothermal-related attributes  
- Here, we apply our unsupervised machine learning method **NMFk** to analyze the available geothermal and geochemical data to understand better the spatial distribution of the hydrothermal resources
- Our study area (below) includes 14,258 data points

## GeoThermalCloud installation

If **GeoThermalCloud** is not installed, first execute in the Julia REPL `import Pkg; Pkg.add("GeoThermalCloud"); import Pkg; Pkg.add("NMFk"); Pkg.add("Mads"); Pkg.add("DelimitedFiles"); Pkg.add("JLD"); Pkg.add("Gadfly"); Pkg.add("Cairo"); Pkg.add("Fontconfig"); Pkg.add("Kriging"); Pkg.add("GMT");`.

## Load and pre-process the data

### Setup the working directory containing the Great Basin data

### Load the data file

### Define names of the data attributes (matrix columns)

Short attribute names are used for coding.

Long attribute names are used for plotting and visualization.

### Define location coordinates

### Map locations

### Pre-processing

It is important to note that a lot of the attribute data are missing.

![gb_duplicatedRows](../data/gb_duplicatedRows.png)

Close to complete records are available only for `Temperature`.

Data for `TDS`, `Al`, and `Î´O18` are heavily missing.

Even though the dataset is very sparse, our ML methods can analyze the inputs.

Most of the commonly used ML methods cannot process datasets that are sparse.

Furthermore, different attributes in the Great Basin dataset cover different areas.

This is demonstrated in the maps generated below.

### Log-transformation

Attribute values are log-transformed to better capture the order of magnitude variability.

All attributes except for `Quartz`, `Chalcedony` and `pH` are log-transformed.

#### Define and normalize the data matrix

### Define a range for the number of signatures to be explored 

### Define directory with exsiting model runs

#### Define the number of NMF runs to be executed

The higher the NMF runs, the better.
In addition, convergence has already been explored using different numbers of NMF runs.

## Perform ML analyses

The **NMFk** algorithm factorizes the normalized data matrix `Xn` into `W` and `H` matrices.
For more information, check out the [**NMFk** website](https://github.com/SmartTensors/NMFk.jl)

Here, the **NMFk** results are loaded from a prior ML run.

As seen from the output above, the NMFk analyses identified that the optimal number of geothermal signatures in the dataset **3**.

Solutions with a number of signatures less than **3** are underfitting.

Solutions with a number of signatures greater than **3** are overfitting and unacceptable.

The set of acceptable solutions are defined by the **NMFk** algorithm as follows:

The acceptable solutions contain 2 and 3 signatures.

### Post-processing NMFk results

#### Number of signatures

Below is a plot representing solution quality (fit) and silhouette width (robustness) for different numbers of signatures `k`:

The plot above also demonstrates that the acceptable solutions contain 2 and 3 signatures.
Note, a solution is accepted if the robustness >0.25.

#### Analysis of the optimal solution

The ML solution with the optimal number of signatures (3) is further analyzed as follows:

The geothermal attributes are clustered into **3** groups:

This grouping is based on analyses of the attribute matrix `W`:

![attributes-3-labeled-sorted](../figures-postprocessing-nl-640/attributes-3-labeled-sorted.png)

The well locations are also clustered into **3** groups.
The grouping is based on analyses of the location matrix `H`.

A spatial map of the locations is obtained:

![locations-3-map](../maps-results-postprocessing-nl-640/locations-3.png)

The map [../figures-postprocessing-nl-640/locations-3-map.html](../figures-postprocessing-nl-640/locations-3-map.html) provides interactive visualization of the extracted location groups (the html file can also be opened with any browser). The interactive map will look like this:

### Discussion of NMFk results

Our ML algorithm extracted **3** signatures in the analyzed dataset.

Signature **B** is detected at 5201 locations shown in the map above.

At these locations, `Temperature`, `Quartz`, `Chalcedony` and `Al` appear to be elevated.
There are general correlations between `Temperature`, `Quartz`, `Chalcedony`, and `Al` observations at these locations.
All these locations can be identified as geothermal resources with high prospectivity.

Signature **C** is detected at 2801 locations shown in the map above.

At these locations, `Temperature` is also elevated. However, `Quartz`, `Chalcedony` and `Al` are low.
However, `Ca` and `Mg` are elevated as well.
All these locations can be identified as geothermal resources with lower prospectivity.
Additional analyses and data acquisition activities are needed to define their prospectivity.

Signature **A** is detected at 6256 locations shown in the map above.

At these locations, `TDS`, `B`, and `Br` are elevated.
However, the `Temperature` is low.
These locations can be identified as geothermal resources with low prospectivity.

Biplots are also generated by the scripts presented above to map the interrelations between the attributes as defined by the extracted **3** signatures, which can also be viewed as basis vectors.
The interpretation of the biplots is consistent with the way eigenanalysis (SVD/PCA) biplots are also interpreted.

![attributes-3-biplots-labeled](../figures-postprocessing-nl-640/attributes-3-biplots-labeled.png)

It clear from the figure above that `Temperature`, `Quartz`, `Chalcedony` and `Al` are generally collocated.

`Ca` and `Mg` are also collocated.

Similarly, `K`, `Li` and `Na` are also collocated.

The coloring of the dots represents the ML clustering of the attributes into **3** groups.

The figure demonstrates that ML algorithm successfully identified attributes that generally have similar spatial patterns.

The biplots can also map the locations at which the data are collected, as shown in the figure below.

![all-3-biplots-labeled](../figures-postprocessing-nl-640/all-3-biplots-labeled.png)

The coloring of the dots represents the ML clustering of the attributes and locations into **3** groups each (**6** groups in total).

The biplots above show how the attribute data is applied to label the locations so that they are optimally grouped into **3** location clusters.

#### Spatial maps of the extracted signatures

The 3 extracted signatures are spatially mapped within the explored domain.

The maps below show the estimated importance of 3 signatures in the Great Basin (red: high; green: low).

Signature B (high) and C (mid) represent areas with geothermal prospectivity.

Signature A defines areas with low geothermal prospectivity according to performed analyses.

It is important to note that these spatial maps are generated using spatial interpolation methods.
There are uncertainties associated with these predictions of geothermal prospectivity.
These uncertainties can be evaluated as well.

It is also important to note that maps generated for Signatures A, B, and C above are representative of a large portion of the Great Basin domain.
This is true even though some of the analyzed data provides partial or very limited converge (as seen in the data maps provided above).
